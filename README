Qt Communication Library
========================
Qt Communication Library is a multiplatform C++ library written for
communication with custom devices e.g. via serial port.

Supported Platforms
===================
The functionality has been tested on the following platforms:
  * Windows XP SP3
  * Arch Linux 32-bit and 64-bit
  * Mac OS X 10.6

Compiling sources
=================
Prerequisites:
  * Qt 4.x
  * Qt SDK or development tools for Qt4

It's recommended that you build Qt Communication Library not in the source
directory, but in a separate directory. To do that, use the following commands:
  $ mkdir $BUILD_DIRECTORY
  $ cd $BUILD_DIRECTORY
  $ qmake $SOURCE_DIRECTORY/qtcreator.pro
  $ make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Other Notes
===========
The code has been inspired by QextSerialPort project. Get more information at

Removing all generated files on Linux/Mac can be done by running trunk/CLEAN.sh.
Full recompilation on Linux/Mac can be done by running trunk/REBUILD.sh.
