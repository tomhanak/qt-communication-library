Qt Communication Library
========================
Qt Communication Library is a multiplatform C++ library written for
communication with various kind of devices.

Supported interfaces:
=====================
  * Serial ports
  * USB to Serial port converters

Supported Platforms
===================
The functionality has been tested on the following platforms:
  * Windows XP SP3 32bits
  * Windows 7 SP1 64bits
  * Arch Linux 32bits
  * Arch Linux 64bits
  * Mac OS X 10.6

Compiling sources
=================
Prerequisites:
  * Qt 4.x
  * Qt SDK or development tools for Qt4

It's recommended that you build Qt Communication Library not in the source
directory, but in a separate directory. To do that, use the following commands
as normal user:
  mkdir $BUILD_DIRECTORY
  cd $BUILD_DIRECTORY
  qmake $SOURCE_DIRECTORY/QtCommunication.pro
  make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)
  make install (super user rights might be needed)
or use following scripts:
  * trunk/REBUILD.sh - cleans and recompiles all sources on Linux/Mac
  * trunk/REBUILD.bat - cleans and recompiles all sources on Windows
  * trunk/CLEAN.sh - removes all generated files on Linux/Mac
  * trunk/CLEAN.bat - removes all generated files on Windows

Other Notes
